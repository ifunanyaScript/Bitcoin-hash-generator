# Bitcoin-hash-generator
This is a simple python program that generates a new blockchain ___block hash___.<br>
The concept of mining bitcoin sometimes seems vague to a lot of people, but I'll try to simplify it.<br>
The blockchain from it's name is a link of several blocks of transactions, i.e There are thousands of tables of transactions<br>
like so;
| Sender      | Receiver    | Amount  |
| ----------- | ----------- |---------|
| user_id     | user_id     | $900    |
| user_id     | user_id     |$45678   |
